# DDM360 Field Guide

## DDM360 Object Relationships
Before using the DDM360 API it is important to understand the relationship between the different object types. At the highest level are Documents. Documents map to a Document in PIM360. Next there are Deliverables. Deliverables are instances of Documents and there can be multiple Deliverables of a Document, but only one per EIC. A Deliverable can have multiple revisions on the same EIC and that revision can have multiple versions. Each version can then have one or more files associated with it.

## Submitting Drawings/Models to BIM360/ACC
When a file is submitted to BIM360/ACC using the `POST /forgeupload` API, it is not instantly available to be used, instead you should use the `GET /forgeupload` API and wait for the `progress` attribute to be "complete" and the `status` attribute to be "success".
